<span class="emphasis">Hypertext Markup Language</span> <span class="secondEmphasis">(HTML)</span> is one of the <span class="emphasis">three</span> cornerstone <span class="emphasis">languages</span>.  

It is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.  

HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.

- This is equivalent to how the human body has a skeleton that provides structure and support.

It is made up of elements which work together to provide content and the basic framework for all pages on the web.

There are multiple types of elements including text, image, header, and list.

Elements are also used to divide the content on the page and to describe the content to browsers and other developers.

Metadata is data about the webpage that the browser uses to serve the webpage to users.

- With the exception of the title tag, metadata is not visible to the user.

Some examples of character encoding are:

- UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, ANSI(Windows-1252), ASCII

HTML attributes are words or pieces of data that modify the behavior or appearance of an element.
