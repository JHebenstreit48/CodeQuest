- Fetch API will make requests to specific API endpoints and process the response.

- HTTP methods are a set of request methods that indicate the desired action to be performed on a resource.

- HTTP methods perform the following actions of: Create, Read, Updated, and Delete.  
    - This is known as the CRUD method.

- Express.js is a lightweight framework for Node.js that allows you to write APIs handlers, HTTP requests, and implement middleware in your server-side applications.

- Frameworks follow a strict set of instructions on how to implement them.

- In contrast to frameworks, a library is more loosely defined and doesn't follow a strict set of instructions.

- Async/await is a feature that makes asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.

- Async/await therefore improves the readability and maintainability of code that involves asynchronous operations.

- Async/await is built on top of promises but it provides a more elegant way to work with them.

- Syncronous code is where JavaScript is trying to run/executes the code from top to bottom as quickly as possible.

- Asychronous code is where any real-world time is introduced to the application, which causes some kind of delay.

- Async/await is usually preferred/recommended because it uses cleaner syntax compared to using .then() and .catch().
