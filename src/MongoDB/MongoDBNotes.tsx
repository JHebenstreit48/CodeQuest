- <span class="emphasis">NoSQL</span> databases like <span class="emphasis">MongoDB</span> are a <span class="emphasis">non-relational database</span> or <span class="emphasis">non-relational database management system (DBMS)</span>.

- <span class="emphasis">MongoDB</span> is an **open-source** database and uses **documents**, **objects**, or **arrays** instead of **tables** and **rows** to **store** **data**. 

- **Documents** in **MongoDB** are equivalent to the **rows** of **data** in **SQL**

- MongoDB uses documents and objects or arrays, instead of Tables and Rows to store data which are used by SQL

- Objects in MongoDB are stored in a format called BSON which is also known as Binary JSON

- BSON looks and acts like JSON but is optimized for faster parsing.

- BSON is structured into key-value pairs.

- Groups of documents are stored in collections.

- In a One to One Model relationship in MongoDB is where you typically have an ObjectID data type in one collection that references or points to an ObjectID with the same value in another collection.  
  - The names of each ObjectID do not have to match but the values of each ObjectID do have to match.
