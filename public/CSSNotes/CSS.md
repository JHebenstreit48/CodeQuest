<span class="emphasis">CSS</span> stands for <span class="emphasis">Cascading Style Sheets</span>.

<span class="emphasis">CSS</span> <span class="secondEmphasis">functions</span> as the <span class="emphasis">styling</span> or <span class="emphasis">skin</span> of a <span class="emphasis">webpage</span>.

<span class="emphasis">CSS</span> is used to determine how the <span class="secondEmphasis">HTML elements</span> <span class="emphasis">appear</span> or are <span class="emphasis">displayed</span> on a <span class="emphasis">webpage</span>.

- For example, a pages colors, aesthetics, visual, layout, and organization.

You can use CSS to style multiple webpages at once.

You can either embed sytlying into HTML or other document types or use an external CSS stylesheet.

- In general using an external stylesheet in most cases is generally considered the best practice.

- Using inline styles excessively may complicate webpage maintenance and readability.

In vanilla HTML if using an external sytlesheet you would reference/link it in the <span class="codeSnip">```<head>```</span> tag.

You must always put a <span class="punctuationSymbol">;</span> at the end of every CSS statement.

When a <span class="punctuationSymbol">.</span> <span class="emphasis">precedes</span> the <span class="emphasis">name</span> of a <span class="emphasis">property</span>, the property is <span class="emphasis">referencing</span> an <span class="emphasis">HTML</span> <span class="secondEmphasis">class</span> that it is <span class="emphasis">assigned</span> to.

When a <span class="punctuationSymbol">#</span> <span class="emphasis">precedes</span> the <span class="emphasis">name</span> of a <span class="emphasis">property</span>, the property is <span class="emphasis">referencing</span> an <span class="emphasis">HTML</span> <span class="secondEmphasis">id</span> that it is <span class="emphasis">assigned</span> to.

You can use CSS media queries to set the styling for how a webpage looks on devices of various screen sizes.

-This is measured using the pixel width of the screen.

- Use can either set a minimum width of pixels or a maximum width.

The CSS box model is a container that contains multiple properties including borders, margin, padding, and the content itself.

Going from the innermost portion of the CSS box model to outer-most portion is as follows:

- content
- padding
- border
- margin

When you combine a CSS property with a value it is known as a declaration.
