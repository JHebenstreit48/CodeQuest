### Creating an Angular Application
---

Angular is a robust and feature-rich framework for building scalable web applications. It uses TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, and is ideal for large-scale applications with complex requirements.

---

### Why Use Angular CLI to Create an Angular App?
<br>

- The Angular CLI provides tools to initialize, develop, and maintain Angular applications efficiently.
- Simplifies setup by automating configurations for TypeScript, Webpack, and other dependencies.
- Provides a predefined project structure for maintainable and scalable code.

### Steps to Create an Angular App
<br>

1. **Install Angular CLI**: Use the Angular CLI for a seamless project setup.
2. **Generate a New Project**: Angular CLI scaffolds a new application and project files automatically.
3. **Serve the Application**: Start a development server and preview the application.

Angular is ideal for enterprise-level applications where a structured framework is required, while React JS is suitable for smaller, lightweight projects.

Angular comes with everything out of the box for enterprise-scale projects, whereas React relies on additional libraries for features like routing and state management.
