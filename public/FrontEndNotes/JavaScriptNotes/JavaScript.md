## Modules
---

JavaScript modules allow developers to organize code into reusable components. When exporting a module, you can rename a function or class to better match the context in which it is being used.

### Managing Import Paths
---

JavaScript allows developers to organize code using imports, which can reference files in different parts of the project.

- **Relative Paths:** Use <span class="emphasis">./</span>, <span class="emphasis">../</span>, or <span class="emphasis">../../</span> to navigate directories. While effective in small projects, they can become unwieldy in larger, deeply nested structures.
- **Path Aliases:** Offer a cleaner alternative. By defining aliases in tools like Webpack or Rollup, developers can use shorthand paths, such as <span class="emphasis">@/</span>, to reference directories like <span class="emphasis">src/</span>.

Path aliases improve readability and reduce the effort required during refactoring.
