# Basic HTML Notes
---

<span class="emphasis">Hypertext Markup Language</span> <span class="secondEmphasis">(HTML)</span> is one of the <span class="emphasis">three</span> cornerstone <span class="emphasis">languages</span>.

It is the <span class="emphasis">standard</span> markup language for <span class="emphasis">documents</span> designed to be displayed in a <span class="emphasis">web browser</span>.

## Structure of HTML

<span class="emphasis">HTML</span> is used to create the <span class="emphasis">structure</span> of a <span class="emphasis">webpage</span>, much like how a skeleton provides structure and support for the human body.

HTML is composed of <span class="emphasis">elements</span>, which define the <span class="emphasis">content</span> and framework of a webpage.

### Examples of common elements:

<span class="bullet3">

- Text
- Images
- Headers
- Lists
- Dividers
- Links

</span>

---

## Metadata
---

<span class="emphasis">Metadata</span> is information about the <span class="emphasis">webpage</span> that helps browsers understand how to serve the page to users.

Notable aspects of metadata:

- The <span class="emphasis">title</span> tag is visible in the browser tab.
- Other metadata, like character encoding, is not visible to users.

### Examples of character encodings:

<span class="bullet1">

- UTF-8
- ISO-8859-1
- ANSI (Windows-1252)
- ASCII

</span>

## Attributes
---

<span class="emphasis">Attributes</span> provide additional information about elements.

Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of elements and are written inside the opening tag. Common examples include:

- <span class="emphasis">id</span>: Unique identifier for an element.
- <span class="emphasis">class</span>: Assigns CSS styling to an element.
- <span class="emphasis">src</span>: Specifies the source of an image or external resource.
- <span class="emphasis">href</span>: Defines the destination of a link.
