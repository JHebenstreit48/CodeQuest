<span class="emphasis">Deployment</span> is the full <span class="emphasis">process</span> of getting an <span class="emphasis">application</span> <span class="secondEmphasis">production</span> ready.

<span class="emphasis">Deployment</span> makes sure the <span class="emphasis">web application</span> is <span class="secondEmphasis">reliable</span>, <span class="secondEmphasis">secure</span>, and properly <span class="secondEmphasis">maintained</span> over time.

A production ready application will include:

<span class="bullet1">

- Environment configuration
- Automated testing
- Version Control
- Security
- Monitoring and logging
- Documentation

DevOps consists of the following:

<span class="bullet2">

- It is a mindset devoted to collaboration, communication, and integration between developers and operations teams.

- Finding ways to solve problems as team culture, or new technology is implemented or released.

- It also implies that you/your company ask themselves:

</span>

   <span class="bullet3">

   - Does this solution solve my/our problem?

   - Is this the tool we need?

   </span>

The goal of DevOps is to foster collaboration and experimentation among teams.

<span class="bullet2">

- It's purpose is to also improve the speed and reliability of projects by automating parts of the development and deployment process.

</span>

You solve problems in DevOps by asking the following questions:

<span class="bullet2">

- Why? = The reasons and motivations behind a strategy.

- What? = The goals and objectices the strategy intends to achieve.

- Who? = The people who benefit from the solution

</span>

Standards in DevOps are established norms or guidelines agreed upon as best practices in an industry or company.

<span class="bullet2">

- They are designed to promote efficiency, consistency, and quality.

- They are more flexible and often change to reflect a team's project or situation

Rules are strict and non-negotiable requirements.

- They generally don't involve collaboration as they often involve legal, security, and safety concerns.

</span>

<span class="bullet2">

- Some examples include:

<span class="bullet3">

   - password and secret key policies
   - access control rules
   - workplace compliance.

</span>

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a set of practices and tools.

<span class="bullet2">

- It automates the process of software development, testing, and deployment.

- It is used to shorten the software development lifecycle for making the product available to customers.

- It bridges the gap between software development and the provisioning and maintenance of the IT infrastructure.

- It also shortens the time needed for deployment, thereby increasing productivity, which therefore results in fewer bugs in the product.

</span>

The CI/CD pipleine consists of a continuous integration, delivery, and a deployment phases.

<span class="bullet2">

- Each phase has a particular task or process to perform.

- Each phase consists of sequential stages.

- Companies can define these stages, which make up their workflows.

</span>

The CI/CD Pipleline stages of development are as follows:

<span class="bullet4">

- Code

- Build

- Integrate

- Test

- Release

- Deploy

</span>

The Continous integration phase spans between the Code through the Test phase

<span class="bullet2">

- This phase automatically integrates and tests code changes

The Continous Delivery phase spans between the Code and Release phases

- This phase automatically releases to a staging environment when all tests pass

The Continuous Deployment phase spans between the Code and Deployment phase

- This phase automatically releases to the production environment if all tests pass
