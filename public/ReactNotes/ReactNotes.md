React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI pieces that are also known as components.

In React a componenet is flexible or reusable.

- This means you define what a component should be once and then use it / render it as many times as you want.

To create a front-end React project you can use the Vite JavaScript build tool.

Props or (properties) let you pass data into a component.

- They are a way of giving any attribute or piece of data to any component.

State is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component

A components state can change over time in response to user actions.

Whenever a component's state changes, the component re-renders.

If you want to use Markdown in React and want it to render on the webpage. You should put the .md files inside your public folder. 

- This will allow the markdown to render on the webpage when you deploy it.

- If you keep it in the source(src) folder it will render when you test it locally, but will not display on the deployed version of the webpage.
