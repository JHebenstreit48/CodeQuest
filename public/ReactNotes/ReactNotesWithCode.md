The following code is an example of a way to add props to a component.

```bash
function Pet(props) {
  return (
    <li>
      {props.name} is a
      {props.species} and is
      {props.age} years old.
    </li>
  );
}
```

The following React function allows us to add a state to your component.

```bash
useState()
```

The following is an example of using useState( ):

```bash
const [name, setName] = useState('Edward');
```

When prompted for a project name during Vite project creation, follow this example to ensure the project is not created within a nested folder.

```bash
? Project name: > .
```
